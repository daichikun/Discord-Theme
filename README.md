# Discord-Theme
A Better Discord Auto Updating Theme.

### Wallpapers
An overview with all current and past wallpapers can be found [Coming Soon](). If the source of an image is known, it will be listed in the description. Please note that some of the images are resized or even flipped sometimes in order to make them compatible for the theme.

### Installation
#### Discord client
1. Make sure the dark theme is enabled in Discord. This custom theme is not made to be used with the light theme, and will look terrible with it.
2. Make sure [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/latest) is successfully installed
3. Download [(skinname).theme.css]() and put it in the BD themes folder (usually `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\themes` on Windows)
4. (Re)start Discord
5. Enable the theme by going to Settings > Themes
6. Done. The theme should be working now and will automatically update
